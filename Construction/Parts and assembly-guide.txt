Assembly-directions:

Procedure:
Step 1:
Solder 12resistors and 12wires to Protoshield.
(Pins a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12), all connected to 5v
Solder 2*wires to ground

Step 2:
Mount prototboard with arduino on backplate, feed 12 wires through frontplate, and assemble the construction with standoffs.

Step 3:
cut and strip wires 15mm from topplate. Mount with "tyller" (white).

Step 4:
Mount groundterminals in frontplate, strip groundwires and solder to terminals.

Step 5:
Secure one side of the wires in 6pcs screwterminals. Mount the terminal to front plate, raised with an additional hexnut. Repeat on the opposite.

Step 6:
Upload code from github, check functionality. Add to equipment library
